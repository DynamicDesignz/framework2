                                             [ Metasploit Framework v2.0 BETA5 ]
Hey!

You have a beta copy of the Metasploit Exploit Framework.

Please, give us feedback, questions, comments, thoughts, ideas.

Send mail to framework@metasploit.com, that will come to both of us.

Our individual email address:
  H D Moore <hdm [at] metasploit.com>
  spoonm <ninjatools [at] hush.com>


To get started, extract the tarball, cd into the directory, and read over
the docs/QUICKSTART files. Pick an interface (cli, console, web) and start
testing. If you have any trouble running the framework, please send us the
complete output of 'perl -V' and any error messages you received.

If there is an exploit that you think would be particularly useful to
include, please let us know. Right now we are working on closing the gap
in the wuftpd, proftpd, MS RPC, and MS Messenger bugs. 


Some notes about this release:

- Windows users: We no longer support ActiveState perl, please use the bundled 
  Cygwin environment if you want to run the Framework on Windows. If you want
  to use your own Cygwin base, please read docs/QUICKSTART.cygwin.

- Read docs/QUICKSTART.tabcompletion. The msfconsole interface will work without
  Term-ReadLine-Gnu, but it isn't nearly is fun. Its all about the tab-tab-tab.

- Read docs/QUICKSTART.ssl to enable SSL support in any exploits that support it. 

- The Pex nop generator is currently set to return a slide of 0x90.  It supports
  random nop sleds, and seems to work most of the time. Random nop sleds may 
  cause certain exploits to fail, these exploits often depend on one or more 
  registers being set to a specific state at the time of the exception. We will
  enable random nop sleds as soon as the exploit modules are modified to state
  exactly which registers must be preserved. If you want to give random sleds a
  shot, you can "setg Msf::Nop::Pex::Random 1" in msfconsole.

- Right now things are a bit slow.  We are reloading all the modules for any
  commands that may be affected by module changes.  If this slowness is really
  annoying let us know, it something we have to make a decent amount of changes
  to fix, but if its important enough it can happen.

- If you are interested to see more of what's going on behind the scenes, you
  can set DebugLevel.  By default it is at 0, and we have log messages for
  up to 5.

- The nop generators and encoders are currently not selectable through an
  interface, but they are configurable.  The Nop and Encoder variables
  are a comma set list of what to try first.  It must be the fully qualified
  name.  For example, to specify the default FnstenvMov encoder,
  "setg Encoder Msf::Encoder::PexFnstenvMov".  There is also Pex, PexAlphaNum,
  and PexFnstenvSub.
