                                             [ Metasploit Framework v2.0 BETA ]
Hey!

You have a beta copy of the Metasploit Exploit Framework.

Please, give us feedback, questions, comments, thoughts, ideas.

Send mail to framework@metasploit.com, that will come to both of us.

Our individual email address:
  H D Moore <hdm [at] metasploit.com>
  spoonm <ninjatools [at] hush.com>


To get started, extract the tarball, cd into the directory, and read over
the docs/QUICKSTART files. Pick an interface (cli, console, web) and start
testing. If you have any trouble running the framework, please send us the
complete output of 'perl -V' and any error messages you received.

If there is an exploit that you think would be particularly useful to
include, please let us know. Right now we are working on closing the gap
in the wuftpd, proftpd, MS RPC, and MS Messenger bugs. 


Some notes about the framework.

- The framework should work fine on any little endian system with a recent
  version of perl installed. If you want to use the framework on Windows, it
  must be run from inside Cygwin (www.cygwin.com). ActiveState perl is NOT 
  supported for a number of really good reasons, please email us if you are
  curious about what they are. Complete instructions for installing Cygwin
  can be found in the docs directory.

- Read docs/QUICKSTART.tabcompletion, this will make using msfconsole so much
  nicer.  Its all about the tab tab tab.

- Read docs/QUICKSTART.ssl to enable SSL support in any exploits that support it. 
  The Cygwin instructions for installing Net::SSLeay are actually invalid, 
  compiling Net::SSLeay actually involves rebuilding perl and openssl first :(

- The Pex nop generator is currently set to return a slide of 0x90.  It supports
  random nop sleds, and seems to work most of the time.  We have had some cases
  where the sled caused trouble during exploitation (and its really annoying
  when developing/debugging stuff).  If you want to give random sleds a shot,
  you can "setg Msf::Nop::Pex::Random 1" in msfconsole.

- Right now things are a bit slow.  We are reloading all the modules for any
  commands that may be affected by module changes.  If this slowness is really
  annoying let us know, it something we have to make a decent amount of changes
  to fix, but if its important enough it can happen.

- If you are interested to see more of what's going on behind the scenes, you
  can set DebugLevel.  By default it is at 0, and we have log messages for
  up to 5.

- The nop generators and encoders are currently not selectable through an
  interface, but they are configurable.  The Nop and Encoder variables
  are a comma set list of what to try first.  It must be the fully qualified
  name.  For example, to specify the default FnstenvMov encoder,
  "setg Encoder Msf::Encoder::PexFnstenvMov".  There is also Pex, PexAlphaNum,
  and PexFnstenvSub.
