                                             [ Metasploit Framework v2.0 BETA ]
Hey!

You have a beta copy of the Metasploit Exploit Framework.

Some notes about the framework.

- Read docs/QUICKSTART.tabcompletion, this will make using msfconsole so much
  nicer.  Its all about the tab tab tab.

- Read docs/QUICKSTART.ssl for SSL support in any exploits that support it.

- The Pex nop generator is currently set to return a slide of \x90.  It supports
  random nop sleds, and seems to work most of the time.  We have had some cases
  where the sled caused trouble during exploitation (and its really annoying
  when developing/debugging stuff).  If you want to give random sleds a shot,
  you can "setg Msf::Nop::Pex::Random 1" in msfconsole.

- Right now things are a bit slow.  We are reloading all the modules for any
  commands that may be affected by module changes.  If this slowness is really
  annoying let us know, it something we have to make a decent amount of changes
  to fix, but if its important enough it can happen.

- If you are interested to see more of whats going on behind the scenes, you
  can set DebugLevel.  By default it is at 0, and we have log messages for
  up to 5.

- The nop generators and encoders are currently not selectable through an
  interface, but they are configurable.  The Nop and Encoder variables
  are a comma set list of what to try first.  It must be the fully qualified
  name.  For example, to use the Fnstenv encoder,
  "setg Encoder Msf::Encoder::Fnstenv".  There is also Pex, and None.

- The following components are disabled in this release.
    + msfweb
    + msfconsole session logging
    + win32 prefork capability
    
- The following is a list of known bugs:
    + BSD bind and findsock payloads are buggy
    + Tab completion does not work correctly under Cygwin
    + The TARGET parameter is not validated prior to being used
