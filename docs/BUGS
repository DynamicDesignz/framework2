Known Bugs and Incompatibilities
==================================

- The linux_ia32_reverse_udp payload requires the --noediting option to be
supported by the bash shell on the target system. This will prevent this 
payload from working on older distributions.

- The linux_ia32_adduser payload may fail on older Linux distributions that use
PAM (namely Red Hat 6.x).
