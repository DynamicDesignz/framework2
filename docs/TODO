 MetaSploit Framework TODO 
===========================

 - Finish rewriting the configuration and logging system in msfconsole

 - Rewrite msfweb to work with new architecture
 
 - Rewrite BSD bind payload (SIGSYS error after listen call) [LSD one is also broken]

 - Determine WTF Advanced options are supposed to do and how they should be set

 - Fix AutoOpts, how to handle?  Possible when we are going to use a exploit, for example to check or exploit, call a function like Init, and this could process AutoOpts, and SetTempEnv for all of its key/val pairs...
