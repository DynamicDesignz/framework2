Pre-Release Tasks
==================

 - Write a quickstart users guide, enough to get them up and running in a few paragraphs. (I'll do this [spn]).

 - Get some basic developer docs?, although the bulk of this can wait a week or two.

 - Configure mailing list, public CVS, bugzilla, etc. Currently waiting on Savannah approval...

 - Add documentation describing how the shared config file relates to msfcli and msfconsole

 - Finish rewriting the configuration and logging system in msfconsole

 - Rewrite msfweb to work with new architecture
 
 - Change the ExternalPayload module so that it does safe argument handling

Post-Release Tasks
===================
 - Rewrite BSD bind payload (SIGSYS error after listen call) [LSD one is also broken]

 - Right now LoadTempEnv, will set the TempEnv to the actual stored hash, so you are modifing the stored hash also,
   this is nice because you don't have to SaveTempEnv before you do a save, but it isn't really intended behavior.
   Load should "load" a copy, you should be able to make changes and ditch it without affecting the saved copy.  
   Maybe this should be changed, and LoadTempEnv should create a copy like SaveTempEnv does.


Far Future
===========

- Complete template/skins/css system for msfweb
