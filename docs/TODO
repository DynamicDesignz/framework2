Pre-Release Tasks
==================


 - Fix msfconsole so that ^C during Exploit with unhandled payload does not kill interface

 - The winadduser payload seems to be completely hosed, need to debug it

 - The winreverse payload does not seem to be setting EXITFUNC correctly

 - Determine the issue with the PREFORK code, it DOES work on some exploits
 
 - Add at least one more windows payload (download url or something)

 - Convert the QUICKSTART.* docs into a decent user guide

 - Finish building out the basic development guides

 - Find a host for the mailing list, public CVS, bugzilla, etc. 
 
 - Add documentation describing how the shared config file relates to msfcli and msfconsole

 - Change the ExternalPayload module so that it does safe argument handling
 
 - Remove any exploits which are just plain broken
 
 
 
Post-Release Tasks
===================
 - Rewrite BSD bind payload (SIGSYS error after listen call) [LSD one is also broken]

 - Right now LoadTempEnv, will set the TempEnv to the actual stored hash, so you are modifing the stored hash also,
   this is nice because you don't have to SaveTempEnv before you do a save, but it isn't really intended behavior.
   Load should "load" a copy, you should be able to make changes and ditch it without affecting the saved copy.  
   Maybe this should be changed, and LoadTempEnv should create a copy like SaveTempEnv does.


Far Future
===========

- Complete template/skins/css system for msfweb
