Pre-Release Tasks
==================

 - Make msfcli do regex match against name, display multiple matches

 - Make some minor cosmetic improvements to msfweb, msfpayload.cgi

 - Flush out Pex::x86
 - Add raw mode support to Pex::Socket (spoof)
 
 - Exchange exploit sucks, remove it or fix it
 - DCOM exploit needs to be fixed so it works on XP again!
 - DCOM exploit needs vulnerability check mode

 - msfencode needs to actually work

 - Convert the QUICKSTART.* docs into a decent user guide
 - Write a new introduction and place into ./README
 - Finish building out the basic development guides
 - Make sure docs refer to shared config between all ui's
 - The Pex library needs documentation and API guides for standalone use 

 - Include other tools in the cygwin envirnment (like what?)

 - Find a host for bugzilla 
 - Send ey4s hookers and booze
 
 
Post-Release Tasks
===================

 - The msfweb interface does not work correctly on Mac OS X
 
 - Multiple return values of Check, not just 0/1, we need 0 for plain not vuln, 1 for looks vuln, 2 for confirmed, -1 for cant exploit, -2 for cant tell

 - Make the OS explicit. Remove win32, make it win2000, winxp, etc, etc for exploits and payloads

 - Rewrite BSD bind payload (SIGSYS error after listen call) [LSD one is also broken]

 - Nop generator needs to work within badchars
 - Nop generator needs mode for PA-RISC, SPARC, etc
 - Nop generator needs a no-mod-regs option to avoid nops which modify regs needed by exploit

 - Fix /usr/bin/env errors for Solaris / perl 5.6

 - Right now LoadTempEnv will set the TempEnv to the actual stored hash, so you are modifing the stored hash also,
   this is nice because you don't have to SaveTempEnv before you do a save, but it isn't really intended behavior.
   Load should "load" a copy, you should be able to make changes and ditch it without affecting the saved copy.  
   Maybe this should be changed, and LoadTempEnv should create a copy like SaveTempEnv does.


Far Future
===========

- Complete template/skins/css system for msfweb
