Pre-Release Tasks
==================

 - Logging needs to be reimplemented!

 - Solaris, bsd, and cmd payloads need to be readded!

 - Nop generator needs to work within badchars
 
 - Nop generator needs mode for PA-RISC, SPARC, etc
 
 - Nop generator needs a no-mod-regs option to avoid nops which modify regs needed by exploit

 X Both send() and Send() truncate at 65k boundary for UDP

 - Fix /usr/bin/env errors for Solaris / perl 5.6

 - Finish writing msfencode 
 
 - The msfweb interface does not work correctly on Mac OS X

 - Multiple return values of Check, not just 0/1, we need 0 for plain not vuln, 1 for looks vuln, 2 for confirmed, -1 for cant exploit, -2 for cant tell

 - Make the OS explicit. Remove win32, make it win2000, winxp, etc, etc for exploits and payloads

 - Determine the issue with the PREFORK code, it DOES work on some exploits
 
 - Convert the QUICKSTART.* docs into a decent user guide

 - Finish building out the basic development guides

 - Find a host for the mailing list, public CVS, bugzilla, etc. 
 
 - Add documentation describing how the shared config file relates to msfcli and msfconsole
 
 - The Pex library needs documentation and API guides for standalone use 

 - Add nasm into cygwin environment

 - Send ey4s hookers and booze
 
 
Post-Release Tasks
===================
 - Rewrite BSD bind payload (SIGSYS error after listen call) [LSD one is also broken]

 - Right now LoadTempEnv will set the TempEnv to the actual stored hash, so you are modifing the stored hash also,
   this is nice because you don't have to SaveTempEnv before you do a save, but it isn't really intended behavior.
   Load should "load" a copy, you should be able to make changes and ditch it without affecting the saved copy.  
   Maybe this should be changed, and LoadTempEnv should create a copy like SaveTempEnv does.


Far Future
===========

- Complete template/skins/css system for msfweb
