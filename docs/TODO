Its about time to get this motha released, seperate this file into two sections,
Things that should be done before this release, and things that can wait.

(I just moved my stuff, you move your stuff).

Things that MUST be done
========================

 - Fix AutoOpts, how to handle?  Possible when we are going to use a exploit, for example to check or exploit, call a function like Init, and this could process AutoOpts, and SetTempEnv for all of its key/val pairs...

- Write a quickstart users guide, enough to get them up and running in a few
  paragraphs. (I'll do this).

- Get some basic developer docs?, although the bulk of this can wait a week or
  two.

- Fixed the PoPToP exploit to use hardcoded strings, and remove all my random
  pptp protocol stuff.

- Get a logo in ascii art form for msfcli and msfconsole and probably msfweb
  (imgs would be harder in msfweb right?).

- A mailing list is a must, a must! msf@metasploit.com?
  framework@metasploit.com?

Things that can wait
====================

 - Get the Encoder/Nop routines fixed so they will follow a specified
   precedence, and then fall through all the other ones on failure.

 - Finish rewriting the configuration and logging system in msfconsole

 - Rewrite msfweb to work with new architecture
 
 - Rewrite BSD bind payload (SIGSYS error after listen call) [LSD one is also broken]

 - Determine WTF Advanced options are supposed to do and how they should be set
(can this be removed?)

- Right now LoadTempEnv, will set the TempEnv to the actual stored hash, so you are modifing the stored hash also, this is nice because you don't have to SaveTempEnv before you do a save, but it isn't really intended behavior.  Load should "load" a copy, you should be able to make changes and ditch it without affecting the saved copy.  Maybe this should be changed, and LoadTempEnv should create a copy like SaveTempEnv does.

- We should push everything to a sub usage, for example exploit Size, in some code we do like $exploit->{'Info'}->{'Payload'}->{'Size'} or $exploit->Info->{'Payload'}->Size, etc etc, we should just do $exploit->Size, this allows overloading by the exploit to calculate Size on the fly (maybe affected by some env parameters?, etc.)

Things that can wait a while, or never get done
===============================================

- Template system for msfweb, skinz baby
