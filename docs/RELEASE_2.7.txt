The Metasploit Framework is an advanced open-source exploit
development platform. The 2.6 release includes three user interfaces,
157 exploits and 79 payloads.

The Framework will run on any modern operating system that has a working
Perl interpreter. The Windows installer includes a slimmed-down version
of the Cygwin environment.

This is a maintenance release - all updates to 2.6 have been rolled into
2.7, along with some new exploits and minor features. 

The changes since the 2.6 release include:

windows:
	* The Windows installer and Cygwin environment has been updated
	* The console size has been greatly improved under Windows

msfupdate:
	* The msfupdate tool has been replaced with Subversion
	* All subversion features (branching, diffs, etc) supported

meterpreter:
	* The SAM extension now works against NX/DEP systems.	
	
exploits:
	* Minor cosmetic improvements to many modules
	* 14 new exploits added since 2.6 was released

payloads:
	* The payload staging system is more reliable for large payloads
	* Size reductions and reliability improvements
