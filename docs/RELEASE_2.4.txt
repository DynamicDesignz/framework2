The Metasploit Framework is an advanced open-source exploit
development platform. The 2.4 release includes three user interfaces,
71 exploits and 75 payloads.

The Framework will run on any modern operating system that has a working
Perl interpreter. The Windows installer includes a slimmed-down version
of the Cygwin environment.

Some highlights in this release:


 - General bug fixes over 2.3
 - Includes the PassiveX staging system
 - New exploits
 - SunRPC API and several SunRPC exploits (snmpXdmid, KCMS)
 - Re-written shelldemo impurity binary
 - More and smaller payloads (including win32_bind and win32_reverse)
  

This release is available from the Metasploit.com web site:
  - Unix:  http://metasploit.com/framework-2.4.tar.gz
  - Win32: http://metasploit.com/framework-2.4.exe

Exploit modules designed for the 2.3 release should maintain
compatibility with 2.4. If you run into any problems using older
modules with this release, please let us know.

The Framework development team consists of four active members and a
handful of part-time contributors. Check out the 'Credits' exploit
module for a complete list of contributors.

You can subscribe to the Metasploit Framework mailing list by sending a
blank email to framework-subscribe[at]metasploit.com. This is the
preferred way to submit bugs, suggest new features, and discuss the
Framework with other users.

If you would like to contact us directly, please email us at:
msfdev[at]metasploit.com.

Starting with the 2.2 release, it is now possible to perform a system-wide
installation of the Framework. Simply extract the tarball into the
directory of your choice and create symbolic links from the msf*
executables to a directory in the system path. Users may maintain their
own exploit module collections by placing them into ~/.msf/exploits/. If
you are interested in adding the Framework to a operating system
distribution, please drop us a line and we will gladly help with the
integration and testing process.

For more information about the Framework and this release in general,
please refer to the online documentation, particularly the User Guide:

We would like to thank Catalin Patulea <cat@vv.carleton.ca> for helping us 
optimize and improve the Opcode DB, queries are now drastically faster.

Enjoy!
