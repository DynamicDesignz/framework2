The Metasploit Framework is an advanced open-source exploit
development platform. The 2.3 release includes three user interfaces,

Exploit modules designed for the 2.2 release should maintain
compatibility with 2.3. If you run into any problems using older
modules with this release, please let us know.

The Framework development team consists of four active members and a
handful of part-time contributors. Check out the 'Credits' exploit
module for a complete list of contributors.

You can subscribe to the Metasploit Framework mailing list by sending a
blank email to framework-subscribe[at]metasploit.com. This is the
preferred way to submit bugs, suggest new features, and discuss the
Framework with other users.

If you would like to contact us directly, please email us at:
msfdev[at]metasploit.com.

Starting with the 2.2 release, it is now possible to perform a system-wide
installation of the Framework. Simply extract the tarball into the
directory of your choice and create symbolic links from the msf*
executables to a directory in the system path. Users may maintain their
own exploit module collections by placing them into ~/.msf/exploits/. If
you are interested in adding the Framework to a operating system
distribution, please drop us a line and we will gladly help with the
integration and testing process.

For more information about the Framework and this release in general,
please refer to the online documentation, particularly the User Guide:

The Opcode Database has been refactored in order to support more granular
queries. The new version provides users with the ability to easily cross
reference specific opcode types, classes, and meta classes across one or more
modules for one or more operating system versions. This level of granular
control allows for a robust and flexible interface that can be used to determine
opcode portability. Aside from opcodes themselves, the opcode database also
contains detailed information about the segments, imports, and exports that are
associated with each module in the database. A quick overview of the features
included in the new database are: 
  - Granular searching of opcodes of a specific type, class, and meta class.
  - Searching modules provided directly from Windbg's module list.
  - Cross referencing opcodes across various operating system version.
  - Detailed module information including segments, imports, and exports.

You can access the beta version of the new Opcode Database at the following url:
